BUG REPORT

Bug Title:  playSmithy() function trashes card 
Bug ID #1
Reported By:  Garret Sweetwood
Date:  08/04/17
Severity:  Medium
Priority:  Medium
File: dominion.c
Line:  1312,1313 (playSmithy())

Description:	Inappropriate game behavior.   According to the rules of Dominion, after the Smithy card is played, it should be discarded into a ‘discard pile’ and NOT trashed (discarded and not to be used again).  The bug here is the variable trashFlag is set to 1 instead of 0.  This variable is passed to the function discardCard().  When trashFlag = 1 in that function, the card is removed from the game.  This behavior is incorrect.  The trashFlag variable should be 0.

Error Message:  “TEST FAILED, card trashed”
